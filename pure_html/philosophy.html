            <p class="paragraph-in-digression">My intresst in philosophy dates back to my early teens. I have always questioned everything and tried to get to the bottom of things - condition which inevitably will lead you to discovering philopshy. Entire high school I have attended philosophy sessions organised by "młodzieżowy dom kultury" where I get to know my philosophical mentor with whom I am still discovering philopshy. My current intresst is in scholasticism - especailly saint Thomas, philosophy of language - Wittgenstein, and postmoderism - Deridda and Foucault.
