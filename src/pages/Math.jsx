          I have always liked math. I have chosen computer science degree purely because of amount of math it required. 
          This is reason why I have chosen specifically INA on PWr - it has computer science curriculum with a solid 
          background in mathematics. My favourite math area is logic, set theory and philosophy of mathematics.
